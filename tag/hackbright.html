Hackbright is an intensive 10-week program that helps women to become software engineers. Everyone comes from different backgrounds - we have bankers, journalists, scientists and more. As for me, I grew up in Siberia as a daughter of fur traders (wat? I know, right?) and came to the US to study Econ and Political Science, which, sadly, turned out to not be fantastic when it came to job prospects. Since I have always loved working on computers, I wanted to explore opportunities of becoming a developer, and this is where Hackbright comes into play. </p>
<p>We have just finished a half point in our studies (only 5 more weeks left!), and to celebrate we organized a happy hour. Well, turns out I am Russian and I take my drinks seriously, so even our most mighty bearded students (metaphorically speaking, we are all women of course) couldn't stand up to their quality. You can read more about it at <a href = "https://perennialmillennial.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/hackbright-week-5/">Kelley's blog </a> - my pair from last week (pair programming rules). </p>
<p>Please feel free to ask me any questions, about Hackbright or anything else - just tweet to me <a href = "twitter.com/ksenish"> @ksenish </a> </p>                </article>
