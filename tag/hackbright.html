It is crazy to think how fast 10 weeks flew by. In the beginning of March I was nervous, terrified of this career change, worried if I really could be a good software engineer. I also had no idea if I would get along with all the women in my class, since I have never been around so many women at a given time ever. It turned out that all my worries were for nothing.  </p>
<p>It is a bit unclear how exactly this happened, but everyone at Hackbright was awesome. Maybe Christian looks at everyone through magical glasses assessing if candidates are right for Hackbright during the interview? It remains a mystery. Hackbright is a very unique group of people of diverse backgrounds, different interests and levels of nerdiness, and everyone is just nice and supportive of each other. I have made some wonderful friends, and I can't even imagine what my life would be like without Hackbright. </p>
<p>One of the culminating points of Hackbright was the Career Day - a speed dating between Hackbrighters and companies. We had 7 minutes to talk about our projects and learn more about the participating companies. Of course it was a short period of time, but it was a great way to get exposed to all these amazing companies. This Career Day was especially exciting because we had companies such as Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, New Relic, StubHub, Perforce, Kabam, Change.org and many others. After the Career Day, I was incredibly overwhelmed with all the emails I got, but also I finally started to realize that this wonderful experience might be coming to am end. Of course, life after Hackbright goes on, but it is very different. If anyone still contemplates if they should make a career switch, I say go for it. I never realized how much I loved programming, and I love it like nothing else. </p><p>There are <a href="../life-after-hackbright.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>

At that time, the San Francisco International Film Festival's program was announced. I have always been interested in film, especially French cinema, and I decided I wanted to work on a project that combined my interest in big data, machine learning, and film. I mentioned this to one of my teachers, Christian, and he suggested that I create a movie prediction algorithm (and eventually assemble into a web app), based on a singular value decomposition (SVD). My first question: singular what? Christian explained it in detail to me. In short, it is a concept in linear algebra. At this point, my first intention was to run away and hide. No, don't get me wrong, I actually enjoy math. I have taken 2 semesters of Calculus, semester of Statistics and another semester of Econometrics in school. But recreating a complex math concept in an algorithm in python when I just started coding 5 weeks ago sounded extremely challenging. Oh, don't worry, that's not going to be the hardest part, said Christian. What is going to be the hardest part then? Make it work on a dataset of 10 million ratings. 10 MILLION?! That's 10,000,000! IT WILL EAT YOUR MEMORY, said Christian. Oh, and it did.

<p>tags: <a href="../tag/hackbright.html">hackbright</a></p></footer><!-- /.post-info -->                Hi everyone, my name is Ksenia and I am a student at Hackbright. Hackbright is an intensive 10-week program that helps women to become software engineers. Everyone comes from different backgrounds - we have bankers, journalists, scientists and more. As for me, I grew up in Siberia as a daughter of fur traders (wat? I know, right?) and came to the US to study Econ and Political Science, which, sadly, turned out to not be fantastic when it came to job prospects. Since I have always loved working on computers, I wanted to explore opportunities of becoming a developer, and this is where Hackbright comes into play.
