Summary: Last week, Rackspace announced that they are suing a patent troll. I think this is awesome, and here is why

Last week, <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/blog/why-rackspace-sued-the-most-notorious-patent-troll-in-america/">Rackspace announced that they are suing a patent troll.</a> Their blog post gives a really good overview of why patent trolls are evil: basically patent trolls hold back innovation and don't make any feasible contributions to the economy. Companies such as Google and Apple spend more on patent lawsuits during a single year than on research and development. Just think about it, the best innovators in the industry have to waste their money in courts rather than creating products. This is why it is so important when companies like Rackspace take a stand and choose to fight. I am curious why they chose to sue IP Nav in Texas - were there reasons besides the fact that Rackspace headquarters is in San Antonio or do their lawyers think there is a better chance for them to win in Texas rather than California? Guess this question is to remain unanswered to the general public for now, but I can't to see what the court decides.
