Summary: Facebook and the Gates Foundation HackEd 2.0 hackathon

Today was an exciting day, because it was my first hackathon! Facebook and the Gates Foundation HackEd 2.0 is a hackathon dedicated to creating apps that help students, especially low income and first generation students, to get into and stay in college as well as to provide support after. You can read more about it in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/us/hackathons-to-create-education-apps.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0">yesterday's article in the NYTimes</a>.

For me today was also exciting because it was my first time at Facebook. Recently, I have been fascinated with Facebook's COO, Sharyl Sandberg, ever since her book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947/">Lean In</a>, came out last month and to my surprise, she was one of the keynote speakers for the event! Her book motivated me to be more assertive and explore more opportunities, and it was great to finally see her in person, even if it was only for few minutes. 

During the hackathon, my team started a web app called InternshipLife, that will guide students through the process of getting an internship, working an internship, and providing options after. At the end of the day, it was still a work in progress, but I really enjoyed working on this idea, and thought my teammate and the fellow Hackbrighter Melanie gave an excellent pitch for our app.
