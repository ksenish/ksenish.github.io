It is crazy to think how fast 10 weeks flew by. In the beginning of March I was nervous, terrified of this career change, worried if I really could be a good software engineer. I also had no idea if I would get along with all the women in my class, since I have never been around so many women at a given time ever. It turned out that all my worries were for nothing.  </p>
<p>It is a bit unclear how exactly this happened, but everyone at Hackbright was awesome. Maybe Christian looks at everyone through magical glasses assessing if candidates are right for Hackbright during the interview? It remains a mystery. Hackbright is a very unique group of people of diverse backgrounds, different interests and levels of nerdiness, and everyone is just nice and supportive of each other. I have made some wonderful friends, and I can't even imagine what my life would be like without Hackbright. </p>
<p>One of the culminating points of Hackbright was the Career Day - a speed dating between Hackbrighters and companies. We had 7 minutes to talk about our projects and learn more about the participating companies. Of course it was a short period of time, but it was a great way to get exposed to all these amazing companies. This Career Day was especially exciting because we had companies such as Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, New Relic, StubHub, Perforce, Kabam, Change.org and many others. After the Career Day, I was incredibly overwhelmed with all the emails I got, but also I finally started to realize that this wonderful experience might be coming to am end. Of course, life after Hackbright goes on, but it is very different. If anyone still contemplates if they should make a career switch, I say go for it. I never realized how much I loved programming, and I love it like nothing else. </p>
